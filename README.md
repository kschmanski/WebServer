# WebServer
A Web Server that will work in Firefox to display files and navigate directories

To run the web server, you must have Java 10 installed.  Download MyWebServer.java, open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder in which the file has been downloaded.  Then, simply compile and run the program:

> javac MyWebServer.java
> java MyWebServer

This will start up the Web Server, which defaults to using port 2540.

Once the Web Server is running, copy and paste the following into your Firefox browser:
localhost:2540

You should be able to see the contents of the directory in which the program is running, but not be able to navigate further up the directory hierarchy (for example, to see System files, etc.).  Enjoy!
